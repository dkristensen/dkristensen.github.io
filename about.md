I am from Boise, Idaho, but I moved to Tacoma, Washington to attend the [University of Puget Sound](https://www.pugetsound.edu/). I am expecting to graduate in the spring of 2018 with majors in both Computer Science and Mathematics. I am interested in Artificial Intelligence and more specifically with Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning. My current plan is to pursue a PhD in Machine Learning to best set myself up to help the field of Reinforcement Learning make advances.

My current research interests are in the field of reinforcement learning. My senior capstone project is an exploration into applying reinforcement learning techniques to traffic light systems in a city environment to best optimize the traffic flow.

Outside of the classroom, I recently wrapped up my college football career as a [kicker and punter](http://www.loggerathletics.com/sports/fball/2017-18/bios/kristensen_drew_45c9?view=bio) for the University of Puget Sound Loggers.
