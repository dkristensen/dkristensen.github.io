I am from Boise, Idaho, but I moved to Tacoma, Washington to attend the [University of Puget Sound](https://www.pugetsound.edu/). I graduated in the spring of 2018 with majors in both Computer Science (with honors) and Mathematics. I am planning on attending l'Université de Montréal for my Masters in Computer Science and hope to pursue a PhD in Machine Learning after the Masters. I am interested in Artificial Intelligence and more specifically with Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

My current research interests are in the field of reinforcement learning. My senior capstone project was an [exploration into applying reinforcement learning techniques to traffic light systems in a city environment](../Capstone) to best optimize the traffic flow.

Outside of the classroom, I wrapped up my college football career as a [kicker and punter](http://www.loggerathletics.com/sports/fball/2017-18/bios/kristensen_drew_45c9?view=bio) last year for the University of Puget Sound Loggers.
