We trained a convolution neural network on examples of both sea lions of all types as well as on sections of the images that didnâ€™t pertain to sea lions. On our test data, we achieved a 10% error rate whereas on the raw images themselves, we had around 40% error rate. Our network consisted of three convolution layers, each paired with a pooling layer,and two hidden layers with 256 and 128 neurons respectively.
