# Introduction
 
With the increase in both number of social media platforms and amount of data being shared on them, predicting usersâ€™ habits and preferences is becoming an increasingly important task for both marketing firms and online retailers. For this project, we were given information from users taken from Facebook.com and asked to predict their age, their gender, and 5 personality traits from this data. This meant we had to combine both regression methods and classification methods in order to achieve sufficient results, and we applied several different techniques during the course of the quarter in order to investigate the efficacy of each approach. We found that with the combined model of Gradient Boosting and Neural networks, we were able to achieve scores better than the baselines by a minimum of just under 1 percent and a maximum of just over 30 percent.
