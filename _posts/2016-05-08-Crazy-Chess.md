# Introduction

Crazy Chess was the term project for the Software Engineering Class at the University of Puget Sound. We used the MEAN.JS framework to create a web application where users can all play chess together, where any user can play for whichever color's turn it is, whichever piece they want to. This chaos is what gives Crazy Chess the crazy. We used Angular.JS to implement the AngularChess framework for our chess. We also implemented a global and individual scoreboard.
