As per the instructions of the 2018 Mathematical Competition in Modeling (MCM), two friends and myself entered as a team, submitting an answer for problem C. This problem asked us to designing an energy compact between the states of Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California to shift their non-renewables to green energy sources with two deadlines of 2025 and 2050. We were given 50 years of data for over 200 variables for each state up until 2009. We approached the problem by splitting the model that predicted the energy growth moving forward for each state and the model that represented our actions taken on the states' energy productions, which only lead to a simplistic model but allowed us to explain the model as best we could. We placed as successful participants, which is less than we had hoped, but we had fun doing it and learned a lot from the project.
