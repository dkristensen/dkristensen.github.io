# Introduction 

While many lifeforms on earth have beautifully complex interactions with the environment around them as well as other members of their species that humans are still baffled by, the field of biological modelling is unraveling many of the mysteries behind these animals and their actions. The goal of this paper is to show that as we develop more mathematical models of animals, the less credit we can give to claims that the animals are conscious in a capacity beyond what machines and computers are capable of. Using parts of Rene Descartes’, automation theorists of the 1800’s, John Searle, and David Chalmer’s philosophies and arguments, this paper isolates how each algorithm detracts from the potential for consciousness from the animals. Lastly, the paper poses an alternative conclusion for the outcome on the consciousness of the animals explored as it pertains to AI.
